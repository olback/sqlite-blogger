# SQLite Blogger

A Simple CMS to that does not rely on MySQL or Postgresql but uses a SQLite database instead. This means that you can host this wherever you have access to PHP.

#### Getting started
Rename 'sample-config.php' to 'config.php' and you're all good!


#### Why isn't the config file called `config.php` already?!
Because `config.php` is in the gitignore file to prevent overriding when updating.
